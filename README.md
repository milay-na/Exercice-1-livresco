Displaying the Fibonacci numbers, with a different color associated to each number. A button allows the user to generate the next 100 numbers.
This assignement uses HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

Some browsers are yet to implement BigInt, check [MDN documentation of BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt).
